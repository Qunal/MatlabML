Machine Learning in Mining

This demo shows how machine learning can be used to imporve the accuracy of modelling and predicting the output of an iron ore processing plant. A number of variables in the plant were measured over time including the silica (SiO2) and magnesia (MgO) concentration at the output of the plant. The goal of the modelling is to determine what parameters in the plant need to be adjusted to keep the silica and magnesia concentration at the desired level. The demo uses 1 year of real data captured in an iron-ore processing plant. The mining company has given MathWorks permission to use this data.



This demo shows:

  a) Preparing time series data for analysis

  b) Interpolating missing data

  c) Time aligning and joining multiple data sets using tables

  d) Using decision trees and neural networks to improve the model calculated using multiple linear regression

  e) Using sequential feature selection to identify the imporatnt parameters in the plant



Note: this demo needs to be run in MATLAB R2014a or later because of a bug in opening spreadsheets that exists in R2013b and earlier.
